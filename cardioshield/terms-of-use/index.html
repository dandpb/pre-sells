            cancel your order and if previously charged, your credit card will be fully refunded for that specific order.</p>
        <p class="comn-para">We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer
            account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number

        </ol>
        <p class="comn-para">Unless otherwise stated on the Website at the time of purchase, Apollo Research Ltd reserves the right to add applicable shipping and handling fees to your order. Unless otherwise stated, Apollo Research Ltd will use commercially reasonable efforts
            to fulfill your order within a reasonable time after receipt of your properly completed and verified order. Although Apollo Research Ltd may provide delivery or shipment timeframes or dates, such as those above, such dates are good-faith estimates
            and are subject to change. You further understand that product availability may be limited and particular products may not be available for immediate delivery. If your order will be delayed, Apollo Research Ltd will contact you at the e-mail

            shall not be liable for any loss, damage, cost, or expense related to any delay in shipment or delivery caused by any third party carrier or other delivery service not owned or controlled by Apollo Research Ltd. The risk of loss and title
            for such items pass to you upon our delivery to any third party carrier.</p>
        <p class="comn-hdng">SECTION 7 – ACCURACY OF BILLING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</p>
        <p class="comn-para">You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases made on our Website. By placing an order, you represent and warrant that you will only provide payment information which is yours or information
            you are authorized to use and provide to us for purposes of placing an order. Apollo Research Ltd reserves the right to cancel any order or to suspend or terminate your account if we have grounds to believe that you have provided inaccurate,
            not current, fraudulent, or incomplete payment information to Apollo Research Ltd, or for any other reason that we, in our sole discretion, believe appropriate. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your
            email address and credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed.</p>
        <p class="comn-para">It is important to note that we continue to see an increase in fraudulent transactions over the internet. Unfortunately, much of this fraud is perpetrated by customers who have legitimately purchased products, but later deny having done so to
            their credit card companies. Please keep in mind that this practice is illegal and may be punishable by imprisonment and/or fines. We reserve the right to fully investigate all claims of credit card fraud which may include asking you to sign
            an affidavit. In addition, if you perpetrate such fraudulent activity, your credit card may be “black listed” by your credit card company, payment processors, and/or retailers, and may be unable to be used for any internet purchases. If you
            are not satisfied with our Apollo Research Ltd product, simply ask for a refund under our <a href="http://getcardioshield.com/refund" target="_blank">RETURNS POLICY</a> or call us so that we can help you resolve any issues or concerns.</p>
        <p class="comn-hdng">SECTION 8 – RETURNS POLICY</p>
        <p class="comn-para">We are not responsible for lost or stolen items, nor items damaged during shipment or damaged by you. You may return items in accordance with the <a href="http://getcardioshield.com/refund" target="_blank">RETURNS POLICY</a> posted on this Website.

                part of your order) back to our fulfillment facility within 180 days of the date you originally ordered the product. Missing or used bottles that were not sent back, that you may be requesting a refund for, must match the time the product
                was used. Each bottle is a 1 month supply, please keep this in mind..</p>

                has received the package and relayed the correct information to us, you will be issued a refund. Your refund will be credited back to your bank account and may take up to 3-7 business days to show in your statement, depending on the speed
                of the processing bank.
